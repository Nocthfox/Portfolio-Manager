# Portfolio-Manager
This is a a tool to manage and track your cryptocurrency portfolio, including investments and profits/losses.
----------------------
In this code, we define a Portfolio class that represents a cryptocurrency portfolio. The class has the following methods:

-  ``` __init__ ```: Initializes the portfolio with an empty holdings dictionary.
-  ```add_holding```: Adds a new holding to the portfolio with the symbol, quantity, and purchase price.
-  ```update_holding```: Updates the quantity and purchase price of an existing holding.
-  ```remove_holding```: Removes a holding from the portfolio.
-  ```calculate_profit_loss```: Calculates the profit/loss for a holding based on the current price.
-  ```generate_portfolio_report```: Generates a report of the portfolio holdings, current prices, and profit/loss.

  
In the example usage, we create a Portfolio object and perform various operations on it. We add holdings for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), update the ETH holding, remove the BTC holding, calculate the profit/loss for the ETH holding, and generate a portfolio report.
